# Chapter01 - by Tooster

`#` is life. `!` is difficulty. Yellow score is highscore. Highscore is on start screen. Reach as far as you can. Highscore not saved on game exit!

Controls:

- `[Escape]` anytime to go back to start screen
- `[Left/Right Arrow]` to change lanes left/right
- `[F,G,H,J,K]` to change to line 1,2,3,4,5
- `[L,Up Arrow]` to fast forward
- `[Space]` to start
- `[Return]` when not playing to change initial difficulty
- `[Q]` to quit the game
