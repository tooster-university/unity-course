# Unity course repo
Games I made for a Unity course on university.

> *Unity is kinda shitty but it itn't... but it is a little bit...* - me

Not gonna lie - some assets are not mine but straight up... ekhem... "borrowed" from the net. Some were free on free to use licenses, some were just pictures without author, name or any info. I DID NOT MAKE THEM - I found them via Google Images. I don't claim any profit nor even believe that this repo will be seen by anyone sooooo... imma use 'em anyway xD.
